# Telegram Bot Template

This is a template project for a Telegram Bot using the the [Telegram.Bot](https://github.com/TelegramBots/telegram.bot) Nuget Package. After you install the template and created the project using `dotnet new` you can navigate to the `Commands` folder and add your custom commands. Since this is only a template and not some sort of framework it is a way of getting started quickly building your Telegram Bot. You can then extend or alter in any way you want.

## Features

- Automatically discover your commands
- Simple ready to use project that can be enhanced
- No extra framework
- Sample commands
- Dockerfile included (run your bot by calling `docker run ... -e Telegram:ApiKey=...`)

## Using the template

### Installation

From NuGet:

```
dotnet new -i TelegramBotTemplate
```

Locally built nupkg:

```
dotnet new -i TelegramBotTemplate.x.x.x.nupkg
```

Local folder:

```
dotnet new -i <PATH>
```

Where `<PATH>` is the path to the folder containing .template.config.

### Run

```
dotnet new telegram-bot -n <YourCompany.Bot>
```

Use the `-n` or `--name` parameter to change the name of the output created. This string is also used to substitute the namespace name in the .cs file for the project.

### Uninstall

```
dotnet new -u TelegramBotTemplate
```

## Using the docker file

### Building the image

```
docker build . -t <NameOfYourImage>
```

### Run the image

```
docker run <NameOfYourImage> -e Telegram:ApiKey=<YourTelegramApiKey>
```

You can add the `-it` parameter to the `docker run` command to start the container in the interactive mode and see the log output.
